# New Features Guide

## ðŸŽ‰ What's New

Your Discord bot now has these awesome features powered by OpenRouter:

### 1. **Natural "Claude" Mentions**
- Just say "Claude" anywhere in your message and the bot will respond
- No need to @ mention anymore (but that still works too!)
- Example: "Hey Claude, what's the weather like?"

### 2. **Discord Message Tools**
The bot can now:
- **Look at recent messages**: "Claude, what were we talking about earlier?"
- **Search messages**: "Claude, find when we discussed the meeting time"
- **Get channel info**: "Claude, tell me about this channel"

### 3. **Web Search (:online)**
Use web-enabled models to search the internet:
- Switch to an :online model with `/model` (e.g., `openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet:online`)
- Then ask: "Claude, what's the latest news about AI?"

### 4. **Multiple Models**
Switch between different AI models:
- `/model` - See available models
- Popular choices:
  - `openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet` - Claude 3.5 Sonnet
  - `openrouter/openai/gpt-4o` - GPT-4 Omni
  - `openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:free` - Free Gemini model

### 5. **Natural Responses**
- Messages now appear like a human typing
- No more bulky embeds for regular messages
- Clean, conversational style

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to:

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

- **Bot not responding to "Claude"**: Make sure the bot has permission to read messages in the channel
- **Tools not working**: Ensure `enable_tools: true` in config.yaml
- **Web search not working**: Use a model with `:online` suffix
- **Rate limits**: Consider using different models or adding a small delay between requests
